> The missing TUI for ngrok

Mole is a terminal-based user interface for monitoring and debugging ngrok traffic. Stop context-switching to your browser — inspect webhooks, replay requests, and debug APIs without leaving your terminal.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features
- **Real-time traffic monitoring** — Watch HTTP requests flow through your ngrok tunnel
- **Request inspection** — View headers and body with JSON syntax highlighting
- **Responsive layout** — Adapts to your terminal size automatically

### Request Management
- **Replay requests** — Re-send any captured request with a single keystroke (`r`)
- **Replay with edit** — Modify method, path, headers, or body before replaying (`R`)
- **Diff view** — Compare two requests side-by-side to spot differences (`d`)
- **Copy as cURL** — Copy any request as a cURL command to clipboard (`c`)

### Search & Filter
- **Real-time search** — Search requests by path, method, or body content (`/`)
- **Advanced filtering** — Filter by status code, method, duration, path, and more (`f`)
  - Supports operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `match`, `!match`
  - Chain multiple filters with `&&` (AND) or `||` (OR)

### History & Persistence
- **Session history** — Browse and search past sessions (`h`)
- **Persistent storage** — All requests are saved to local SQLite database

### Navigation
- **Vim-style keybindings** — Navigate with `j`/`k`, `g`/`G`, and other familiar keys
- **Panel switching** — Toggle between list and detail panels with `Tab`
- **Scrollable detail view** — Scroll through large request/response bodies
